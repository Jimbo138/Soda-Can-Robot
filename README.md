# Soda-Can-Robot

The Soda Can Robot is a multi-purpose Discord App bot.

# Requirements

The Soda Can Robot requires the end user to have the latest versions (as of 5 Jan 2017) of Node.js, Discord.js, mathjs, and ffmpeg installed onto their computer.
The user can run the Soda Can Robot by editing the batch file and javascript file in the repository to serve their needs.
Currently, Soda Can Robot can only play .mp3 files over voice.
All edits that are required to be made in the javascript file aren't completely clear just yet, so PM me if you have trouble getting it to work.
Soda Can Robot is a huge WIP and I have many additional features planned.
